        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I’ve developed a variety of practical projects that highlight my technical skills. My primary projects
            include Rustle, a virtual assistant I designed to help users with tasks by providing quick and relevant
            responses, similar to popular AI assistants. Another key project is a weather application that delivers
            comprehensive weather data for any specified location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and
            forecast details. These projects not only demonstrate my ability to manage real-time data and API
            integrations but also reflect my focus on user experience and functionality. Together, they’ve helped me
            build strong problem-solving and programming skills.</p>
